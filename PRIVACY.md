# Privacy Policy — Markdown PR — Markdown PR Comments for GitHub

**Effective date:** May 18, 2026

Markdown PR — Markdown PR Comments for GitHub is a browser extension that adds inline commenting to GitHub Pull Request rich-diff (rendered markdown) views.

## What data the extension accesses

The extension runs as a content script on `https://github.com/*/pull/*` pages. While on those pages it reads:

- The rendered DOM of the page (paragraphs, headings, tables, code blocks) to position comment affordances.
- The raw markdown source of files in the PR, fetched from the same `github.com` origin.
- Existing review threads and PR metadata, fetched from the same `github.com` origin.
- Mentionable-user suggestions for `@mention` autocomplete, fetched from the same `github.com` origin.

## What data the extension sends

The extension sends data **only to `github.com`**, the same origin you are already logged into. Requests are made on your behalf using the session cookies your browser already holds for `github.com`, with no separate authentication. Specifically:

- New review comments and replies are posted to `github.com` via the same endpoints the GitHub web UI itself uses.
- Resolve / unresolve actions on review threads, again via GitHub's own endpoints.
- A markdown preview request to `github.com/preview` to render the comment-preview tab.
- A user-suggestions request to `github.com/suggestions/...` for `@mention` autocomplete.

No data is sent to any other server, analytics provider, or third party. The extension contains no telemetry.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `host_permissions: https://github.com/*` | Required to read GitHub pages and make same-origin requests to GitHub's review-comment endpoints. |

The extension does not request any other permissions and does not have access to any other websites.

## Local storage

The extension stores sidebar layout and display preferences in your browser's local storage under the `github.com` origin. It does not store credentials, comment drafts, raw Markdown files, or review-thread contents. Version 1.10.0 also deletes the two legacy PAT-related keys used by an older dormant fallback without reading their values.

## Authentication

The extension does not handle, store, or transmit your GitHub password or a Personal Access Token. Authentication is performed by the GitHub session already established in your browser. Requests succeed only if your signed-in GitHub account is allowed to perform the same action.

## Children

The extension is not directed at children and does not knowingly collect any data from children.

## Changes

Any future change to this policy will be committed to the extension's source repository and reflected in the published version.

## Contact

The extension is open-source. Source and issues:
